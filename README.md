This is an Encryptor

The "encryptor" is a substitution cypher where a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, etc. 
There is currently no form of decryption and it only encrypts strings.
It was made in python simply becuase c++ only offers character replacement in strings with a very complicated libray and I dont want to do that.
This was a concept project just to see if it was possible.
