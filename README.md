# binary-encryptor
A simple encryptor.
I made this as a proof of concept and figured I could post the source code on github. It's made in python and uses a simple "code"(a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, etc) to ecrypt a string inputted by the user. Feel free to use this is any way that you want to, I don't really care.
